# The Louvre Exhibition Project: Second Part

During the Second French War against Italy, which took place between 1799 and 1801, the French army seized numerous Italian works of art. In 1802, the Louvre Museum organized an art exhibition showcasing the most significant pieces acquired during this campaign. The exhibition quickly gained widespread popularity and provoked a variety of reactions in the contemporary press. Many of these press reviews are now archived at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). For this phase of our project, we have expanded our corpus and selected three reviews based on their thematic similarities and content: _Journal du Publiciste_, _Journal des Débats_, and _Journal des Arts_. We will encode these sources using the TEI standard.

This project has two primary objectives:

1. **Contextual Metadata Creation**

We have generated extensive metadata to gain a deeper understanding of the context in which the texts were transcribed and encoded, as well as the nature of the documents, including the author’s intentions and the purpose of the publication.

2. **Encoding Artistic Works and Artists**

We have created three external lists identifying the artworks, the painters (as well as associated patrimonial or political institutions), and the locations mentioned in the texts. These lists will serve as keys for encoding, enabling us to analyze the mobility and provenance of the works and to study the influence and significance of the Louvre Museum within the artistic life of Paris.

The most developed of these lists is the one for artworks, in which we have recorded the current location or conservation status of each piece based on historical research.

This type of encoding is particularly useful for future work, as it effectively functions as a structured database.
