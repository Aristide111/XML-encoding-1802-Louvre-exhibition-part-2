# Reflection Note

The second encoding in TEI has significantly enhanced our analysis. The new version is more logical, better organized, and offers improved interoperability, allowing for a clearer representation of the textual structure. It also facilitates the integration of metadata and external lists, enabling more systematic comparisons, easier querying, and better long-term preservation and reuse of the encoded data


### Three advantages of TEI:

1. The metadata is more comprehensive, allowing us to capture the author’s intentions and the purpose of the text.

2. The external lists are more useful, providing potential for future database creation and advanced analysis.

3. The manuscript descriptions are clearer and more precise, with tags such as `<stamp>` and `<note>` improving readability and detail.

### Three advantages of a custom schema:

1. A custom schema allows the creation of an artwork tag, containing structured data tailored specifically for pictorial works.

2. It enables the inclusion of categories documenting technical procedures, such as the material restoration and conservation of artworks.

3. It allows the recording of temporal or chronological data, which can help track the degradation or condition changes of the artworks during transportation or over time.
